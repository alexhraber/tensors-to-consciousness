## Public API Validation Overlay

### Contract Tests
- All public endpoints MUST have contract tests
- Request/response schema validation on every request
- Compatibility regression tests for each version

### Security Tests
- Authentication bypass tests
- Malformed input handling tests
- Rate limit enforcement tests
- Token expiry/revocation tests
<!-- decapod:capability-overlay:public-api:end -->
## Persistent State Validation Overlay

### Migration Proof Command
- Configure `repo.migration_validation.command` and its arguments as the executable migration proof; file presence is not proof
- The configured command MUST define its working directory, timeout, expected exit code, and evidence output

### Migration Tests
- All migrations MUST have integration tests
- Rollback procedures MUST be tested
- Data integrity checks post-migration

### Persistence Integration Tests
- Repository abstraction tested against real database
- Transaction boundary tests
- Concurrency conflict tests
- Data integrity validation after recovery
<!-- decapod:capability-overlay:persistent-state:end -->
## Background Processing Validation Overlay

### Duplicate Delivery Tests
- Same message delivered multiple times MUST produce same result
- Idempotency key verification
- Verify the declared delivery guarantee; do not claim exactly-once behavior without proof

### Retry Tests
- Configured retry/backoff policy verified
- Configured retry bound or unbounded policy verified
- Poison-work handling verified when the project declares it

### Shutdown Tests
- Graceful drain on signal
- In-flight job completion or safe requeue
- No data loss on forced termination

## Validation Philosophy
> Validation is a release gate, not documentation theater.

## Validation Harness
Define the test and verification harness used by this project.
Key features:
- **Automated Tests**: Unit and integration test suites.
- **Linting & Formatting**: Static analysis tools and checkers.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automatic execution of validation gates on push.

## Generated Spec Refresh Gates
Decapod must keep generated specs synchronized at governance pressure points. Fresh `decapod init` may scaffold a missing specs directory. After initialization, refresh must re-evaluate the existing codebase, preserve authored spec content, update codebase-derived attestations, and refresh the manifest rather than rendering scaffold replacements.

Refresh-capable paths:
- `decapod validate --refresh-specs`
- `decapod rpc --op specs.refresh`
- fresh initialization only: scaffold `.decapod/generated/specs/*.md` when the directory is absent

Refresh output requirements:
- Preserve all authored canonical spec content.
- Re-evaluate repo surfaces and update codebase-derived attestation blocks.
- Update `.decapod/generated/specs/.manifest.json` after writing files.
- Avoid adding parallel project-state or architecture-survey documents outside the canonical spec set.

## Proof Surfaces
- `decapod validate`
- Required test commands:
- `pytest`
- Required integration/e2e commands:

## Promotion Gates

## Blocking Gates
| Gate | Command | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture + interface drift check | `decapod validate` | Gate output |
| Tests pass | project test command | CI + local logs |
| Docs + changelog current | repo docs checks | PR diff |
| Security critical checks pass | security scanner suite | scanner reports |

## Warning Gates
| Gate | Trigger | Follow-up SLA |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage regression warning | Coverage drops below target | 48h |
| Non-blocking perf drift | P95 regression below hard threshold | 72h |

## Evidence Artifacts
| Artifact | Path | Required For |
|---|---|---|
| Validation report | `.decapod/generated/artifacts/provenance/*` | Promotion |
| Test logs | CI artifact store | Promotion |
| Architecture diagram snapshot | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Promotion |
| Changelog entry | `CHANGELOG.md` | Promotion |

## Regression Guardrails
- Baseline references:
- Statistical thresholds (if non-deterministic):
- Rollback criteria:

## Bounded Execution
| Operation | Timeout | Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Validation | 30s | timeout or lock |
| Unit test suite | project-defined | non-zero exit |
| Integration suite | project-defined | non-zero exit |

## Coverage Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests cover critical branches.
- [ ] Integration tests cover key user flows.
- [ ] Failure-path tests cover retries/timeouts.
- [ ] Docs/diagram/changelog updates included.
